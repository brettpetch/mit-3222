# Comedy: Narrative Form

I like to contextualize comedy with regards to entertainment media and television that it is a Narrative form. It goes back to understanding literature. Plays, etc. in sans-script drama, etc. What is the fundamental difference between the comedy and tragedy is that one ends with death, the other with marriage. The objective of comedy is to get you to laugh. We can also see it as a meta genre as it has several sub-genres. 

What are our favourite things to laugh at? 

Taboo and Transgressive humor. 

It's that kind of effect where if you've ever been to a funeral but have the desire to laugh that feels wild.

Maintained the aestetics of presence, etc. if you want a quick tour, wandavision on disney. There's alot going on but the visual style pays omage to the sitcom

The other thing that you might want to look at is that early tv was very experimental.

Malcom in the middle:

- he points up, camera changes.

## Sitcom

We already know most of these, but I'm going to introduce you to some other things, one at a time.

The episode form and the problematic:
John Ellis, the basis for the funny thing that happens each week. Every episode has different stories. Each has a different ... What's the problematic? It's a guy that had to leave his home, it's a fish out of water story.

Three's Company --

Lives with multiple people. Stupid. Funny because it's homophobic. It's conservative, etc.

It's a problematic thing... Honesty about an already-curated lie.

We've got everyone back.

Now that we're done with concept-driven, lets move to characters.

Something like the office is a character driven comedy. After they tried different people, it's amusing in a different way, but if you weren't michael it's not the same.

Drawing attention to the non-normativity.

Incorrigible Characters

Blending between serial and episodic.

Taboo:

The Boys: the ways talking about law enforcement.

Big Mouth: sexualizing children
