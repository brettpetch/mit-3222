# Introduction
Ok, we're going to experiment a bit today, I'm not sure the best way of trying to caputre audio--

If you are not able to make it, we originally tried to do zoom every week. ATM it looks tricky... That's a problem for another day. I'll also be recording the lecture via OWL after the fact.

OK- I think we're good.

Can we do a quick role? I'm going to call your name, yell it out.

## Admin
For this week, just a reminder about a few things. The 2nd assignment is due on Friday, expect that things are ready 2 weeks after. If you can remember to use RTF or Word, it'd be great, it makes it easier.

This week I've asked you to watch *Left of the Dial*

## Radio Survival: Key Terms and Concepts

### The transistor 

- was a huge shift in technology. It made it for people to put the radio in their pocket.

### Target Audiences

- Once they realized radio couldn't compete with TV, they started developing target audiences.

### Format

- Formats come into play here, if you think of different stations, you might choose it over another because it's predictable.

### Counter Programming

- If you were targeting an audience, you might try to lure them away by providing something different. 

### Drive Time
- listening times in the car; a specific window of time. Rush hour: morning and evening 

### Listener vs. Audience

- We also start to see this kind of seperation of audiences as listeners as indidviuals. Audience as a mass. About appealing to listeners.

### Jingles

- Jingles help establish brand authority. They're recognizable, they make you familiar with hosts, DJs, etc. consolidate loyalty.

### Disk Jockey

- Before radio had to compete with television, listeners would bounce from program to program.

### Local vs. National

- Appeal to a local audience vs. a national audience. Traffic tips, etc. Radio will provide local information that is relevant to us.

### Standardization

- People want to know what they're getting. If you want to consistently make money, you need to standardize and make money.

## Radio Lexicon

Tuning in (or out)

Pinkerton talks about the way that our language illustrates the ways we communicate in everyday life. He talks about tuning in/out, taking about on the same frequency, wavelength of other people. The term of radio silence, going off. On/off/under the radar. These consolidate radio as a significant part of our culture.

If you didn't have the option of the physical book, it has some nice images. We also see this shift, where it becomes something that you want to watch something about radio. Another notable one is the 1987 film Good Morning Vietnam

What does a film like *Good Morning Vietnam*, what does it tell us about it? GMVN shows radio as a communal activity, it was also

A DJ has a personality that differentiates them from other people.

Another example is *Frequency* (2000). It focuses on radio as a way of travelling through time.

## Radio Formats
The radio formats is actually tension betwene two functions, affiliation, which denotes the proactive self-selection of an audience to a particular format, and assimilation or proactive formats by station owners and managers to attract audiences to a particular format or station

It also closes you off, for instance look at your father... Maybe he looks at country music. It's different from genre. Very few of us watch just one thing. You may enjoy a few things that you flip between. Because of the way that music is structured/standardized, it can close things off. It doesn't help develop listening tastes.

Top 10 radio formats (american), news/talk, adult contemporary, country, pop, classics, hot ac, classic rock, urban ac, sports.

So lets look at the role of sports in radio.

AM radio was not a great place for music.

In the 50/60's, development of transistor technology. Rock & Roll-- lots of it. DJs were employed by radio stations. It was also the development of top 40 charts. Someone curates a chart for you to be in the know. Some of the implications of this were hybridization. We see a mix of form and content. We have Rock & Roll in TV studios, in the top 40, all to solidify the role of Rock and Roll in the community. It becomes standardized pretty quickly and alot of stations play the same stuff.

Rock and Roll is a mix of white folks playing folk music, Blues, Rock and Roll causes racial mixing... It was about sex and race. We also had the payola scandals, they were pretty much about pay-to-play (cash for hits). It was corrupt. Once people got found-out, the legitimacy of radio was at stake. 

FM Resolution
- Free form, underground, progressive rock.

Facilitated by changes in tech, industry stagnation, regulatory hanges, rising american counterculture of the 60s, vietnam war.

KSAN, Tom Big Daddy Donahue, he was trying to move towards a more pure music aesthetic-- no top 40, no jingles, fewer commericals. This was unpredictable, high fidelity.

### A little more about AM/FM radio

Talk Radio in the 80's

The proliferation of talk radio, we can mean two things. One where the hosts talk, or talk-back radio. talk-back was facilitated by phone technology. The ability to verify what is told to us about the radio...

Talk Radio (1988)

## The Business of Outrage

A few of the left-wing networks had issues getting off the groun. Some people will say it's about shock being profitable. Berry / Sobieraj did an evaluation, they noted that talk-radio was 90% concervative, characterized by outrage. Namecalling, exaggeration, and insulting language were some forms of outrage. Concequences Heightened levels of hyperbole, rage, and social divisions, etc.

Janeane Garafolo, the thoughts on why conservative radio is so popular-- it taps into your lesser-nature. It allows a*holes to think they're doing good things, thinking they're patriots. You turn on the radio, you want to be entertained. 

Is everything OK if it's just entertainment. They're not there to say "this is the truth", they're tickling their brain for a bit. If it doesn't hurt anyone, then how its it right? Everyone will be offended by something. If you look at the time, then there's a degree of "if you don't like it turn it off." Howard Stern was also pushing the boundaries of televison. It's emblematic of what radio was, he had a platform while also making his own.

Arguable you could say if he wasn't as offensive as he is, he wouldn't have been as successfully.

Susan Douglas quote.

Talk radio has little social value because people aren't associated with their speech. Peter Laufer, citizens all know eachother. What they do/say will follow them everywhere.

Podcasts have exploded. You could find one about anything and listen to everything. It took people a while to figure out what it was. It used to have a form of ameteur radio, etc.

So why listen to Podcasts?

Serial Podcast followed the broadcast television model. 

There will be a message sent out to get notes.
