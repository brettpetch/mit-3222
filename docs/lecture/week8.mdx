# Theorizing Audiences I

- Identity, Representation & Reception (Fiske)
  - Social vs Textual production of subjectivity.
  - Encoding / decoding
    - Dominant, oppositional, negotiated reading (Hall); Abberant reading (how messages can be interpreted differently from what was intended by their sender)
  - The power of resonant representation
  - Modes of Reception
    - How (focused or distracted), where (alone, communally, if 2nd, who?), what we watch, the act of watching and the politics of choosing.
- Gender and Community
  - Gendered preferences and social discourse
    - Patriarchal influence on the domestic space - significant given the historical model of 'family viewing'
  - Gossip and oral culture
    - Complex form of 'social cement' which reflects active engagement and meaning making; language is vital to communication and 'talk' can be the basis of larger forms of resistance to the dominant ideology and control
  - Fandom
    - Manifestation of communal talk which constructs meaning as relevant to the fan group and derives social and cultural value through subcultural identity.
    - Defining the fan
      - What is the difference between a viewer and a fan?
      - Are fans associated with particular demos/genres?
      - What kinds of behaviours do fans engage in while viewing; or outside of viewing?
      - How is fandom currently pereived in society.
      - Has this changed over time?
      - Gogglebox (Ch. 4)
          > “Everyone loves watching TV and talking about TV. But the show isn't really about TV. The show is about people's lives, their relationships, their living rooms and the way children and parents talk about TV. It's near real-time because you're watching what happened in the seven days before. That's quite priceless. It captures a cultural response to something that's happening in the world. Gogglebox shows TV in people's living rooms is alive and well and thriving. It is asserting the indispensable role of TV in the fabric of people's lives."

  - Cult TV and Fandom
    - Niche vs. mainstream audiences; cult vs. quality content.
    - Draws fundamental parallels between worshipful reverence for a particular program and spiritual / religious practice
    - Historically predicated on marginality but undergoing a fundamental shift as audience power increases in the age of convergence.
    - As text-base, often signifies the representation of "otherworldliness" and the colflation of fantacy with contemporary reality (Matt Hills). 
    - Some scholars insist that "cult" reflects audience practices rather than the construction of the text itself, others favour a more text-based approach; considering both audiences and making content that makes the most sense.
    > "“In the media, in common usage, and sometimes even in academia, ‘cult’ is often loosely applied to any television programme that is considered offbeat or edgy, that draw a niche audience, that has nostalgic appeal, that is considered emblematic of a particular subculture, or that is considered hip.”

    > “To study fans […] is to study many basic structuring principles of modernity: how we create identity, how we relate to each other, why we watch so much television entertainment, how we envision a better society, and so forth. Studying affect tells us about television entertainment, but it also tells us about the society that television is in.”, Jonathan Gray (2008:49)
  - Fandom and Affect
    - Fans are often constructed through a process of othering which pathologies and stereotypes
    - Being a fan represents an aspect of identity which is both individual and communal
    - Fandom is built both through acceptance and resistance to particular stories and characters.
    - TV moves us both emotionally and vicariously
    - Fan culture is increasingly driven by the commodification of taste and identity.
    - From Mood to Meaning (Vorder & Reinick, 2015)
      - Old view - one-factor - entertaining as hedonic pleasure.
        - Comes at the cost of time, possibly spent better on "more meaningful" things (frankfurt school position)
      - New paradigms - two-factor - "From pleasure seeking to truth seeking"
        - Striving for personal growth and searching for meaning.
          - Political communication - being asked to focus on entertainment instead of education leads users to feel both entertained and informed, while users asked to focus on information/education did not report the same level of cognitive engagement and satisfaction.
        - Seeking intrisic need satisfaction (interacctive media facilities well)
          - Eudaimonic need fulfilment (happiness/self-actualization)

      - The Great Divide: Norman Lear, Archie Bunker, and the rise of the bad fan (The New Yorker)
        - “By giving bigotry a human face, Norman Lear believed, his show could help liberate American TV viewers. He hoped that audiences would embrace Archie but reject his beliefs.
        - [But] audiences liked Archie […] Not in an ironic way, not in a so-racist-he’s-funny way; Archie was TV royalty because fans saw him as one of their own.”
