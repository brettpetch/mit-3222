## Administration

## Growing up with TV: identity, memory, affect.

Talking about television as an affect. TV might be a tension space now, it's a place we retreat when we can't cope with anything else. I'm becoming increasingly aware of how pervasive it is.

I can't explain why I have watched the same season of The Office 10x. Newcomb wrote Television: The Critical View. In 2012, when people were trying to review their experience.

> “It may be difficult to describe for you, for you to understand what a television program like Route 66 might have meant to a group of high school seniors in a small high school in Mississippi in 1960. It was a group reading Kerouac, listening to Dylan and Stravinsky and the Dave Brubeck Quartet’s “Take Five.” Watching Peter Gunn and La Dolce Vita as well as Route 66. And all of this caught up in the swirl of the Civil Rights Movement taking place outside our doors and the emergence of the other great historical event that marked our lives from that time forward.”
> ~ Horace Newcomb (2012)

TV is now timeless in streaming. It's different how you watch it in time/space.

I'm going to talk about my own experiences, then you can share.

### Moonlighting

[Moonlighting (1985-1990)](https://trakt.tv/shows/moonlighting) - They did episodes that were all black and white, taming of the shrew. We didn't see this intertextuality at the time.

Breaking the 4th wall. It's a theatre term. You break the 4th wall when you acknowledge that the whole thing is constructed. They're doubling, they're also acknowledging how fast they talked, how they ran short, the production delays, etc. It was directly AT the audience. 

### Seinfeld
The Pen -- The first few seasons weren't all that great. I used to record it on VCR. Then I wouldn't have time to watch it-- I'd then binge them all. When Seinfeld started to go off, my dad and I would have our own language. We both went on vacation. When we met at the airport, we said "UNCLE LEO!!". It drives my mom nuts.

## Television Studies

"All three key metaphors of television tehory... risk being outmoded or at least less adequate as we approach the next century." This reading is no longer assigned because it's important to... talks about TV 

Hopefully it helps you understand how intrasectional it is.

Quantitative research - research being done in psych, sociology, comms dpts. It's about the effects of media, what does violence in media do to people? what's going on in the news? it's funded by assumptions about negative effects. It's a response to people who were worried about what television would do to them.

If we go to humantities, we go to the -- culture studies, mass culture critics, etc. Culture theory is really about dealing with subjectivity. It thinks about different ways that people talk to eachother, the ideological messages embedded in text. It's qualitative research about reception.

## Defining Television

Literally: "distant signt". 

Television is a miracle in the beginning. You could see what happens from far away. But it's complicated. It's connected to ideas of baring witness. The Holocaust was real because of the images people saw. There was agreement reality. An example I used to give: have you been to china, if not, how do you know it exists?

You have to test your reality a little bit longer. 

The technological definition of television is very limited. We need to realize it's a oscial realized structure, both in the technical form and the production behind it. The idea for broadcast entertainment has been around since the late 1800s. Robida used the idea of using electricity. Theatre productions, battle reports. 1880's... The scene from the teatre and circus strongwoman.

### Edison's Telephonoscope

Telegraphy. At one point it was an idea that would transmit sound while projecting an image. They have a flaired tubes, talking back and forth. It took a long time to make that idea ours. 

### Liveness
It's about broadening the gap. Think of why you might want to take notes on a computer. There's a desire for technology to bring things to us in real-time. In breaking down on live television, it drives the connection to the audience.

Through tv we get to experience life as it is. 

Early TV broadcsts were designed to watch in public. That's what they were doing in Europe. Germany had invested in TV heavily leading up to and during WWII. Used viewing halls.

People were starting to think about how tv was going to be closer to film. It was much smaller. 

There was a shift to domestic viewing, where people would bring the public space into the private space. The way where if you think about how all the furnature was organized around the TV set, that wasn't a thing before TV. A big question in the 50's was "where should I put a TV?". It got shortened to the "family room" from the "family televsiion room".

TV was seen as a way of teaching people how to read. Bring people together, advertised as people surrounding the TV. It became aspirational as well. 

Duoscope from dumont. It looks like someone split the TV screen down the middle. It was an interesting idea, but easier and cheaper to buy 2 different sets.

Domestic ideals were also reinforced by TV. 

## TV Benefits

Family togetherness. Parents hoped that TV would help people entertained in the home instead of becoming a delinquent. Rise of gangs, etc.

Credited to improve marital relationships as well.

## negative
Safety. People were like-- we don't need the family to be together anymore. Worries that it would create issues with gender dynamics. TV was reward and punishment. It was structured around putting TV where it wasn't distracting or accessible. Adults also imposing their cultural tastes on someone else. With only one set in the home, people would only be able to watch what the leader of the household could.

Worries about subservant power of men, etc. Had an opportunity for subversive autonomy. They decided where TVs went. 

BBC: the essence of the public service broadcasting is to make popular...

W1a, is a postal code of where the BBC is located in london.

## Commercial TV and Televisial Flow

While he's in a hotel, (Raymond Williams), he's trying to articulate the particular ways that the .. of viewing. Programmed series by a timed sequential units, etc. The real interal organization is different from the declared organization..

It's a strategy that comes with the whole experience.

## Critiques of Flow

People watch specific programs. People wanted to talk about it. The power argument isn't very compelling. People watch passively, glancing not gazing. If you're not fully engaged, how much power does it have?

Carry over from the fear of the WWII technology. People who saw how mass media was used were not so crazy about what TV could do. They also knew that TV was used for surveillance. 

## intertextuality
It's about understanding how all texts are reliant on other texts to a degree. If I were to ask you what are the elements of a procedural crime series?

    - Info
    - Points towards one person
    - by end of series, problem/solution format.

## Overflow, Convergence & Paratextuality
- Overflow
Not just about the schedule, it's about the media itself having flow. Dawson's creek. These shows that produce all this content outside of the show itself. Dawson's Creek, The Office, etc. It decenters the program as neccessarily to the point of origin. As we think about our own ... fandom. Another thing we talk about is

Existed pre-internet. 

- Convergence Culture
This is really about the platform. We need the internet. We see alot of textual poaching (engaging with texts in proactive ways [fanfic]). Larger question: has it democratized audience?

Idea of shaping and participating in how content moved forward. 

- Paratexts

Paratexts, posters, everything leading up to the release: prime expectations. You might get let-down. You've had experiences of being disappointed after the text. 

In media res paratexts: bonus material that changes the way we shape the the text while we're watchign it.
