## Intro

- Quote from Radio Gaga, vocals of the song make us think of a Freddie Mercury song. Was actually written by the drummer, Roger Taylor. Taylor's son that referred to the song on the radio as Radio KaKa. Lady Gaga also credits the name with her stage name.

Douglas: early introduction. The social importance of radio at the time. Past the prime, whistfulness in her musings in the ways we talk about old technology.

### Nostalgia.

She says that radio is about nostalgia, radio's role in contstructing the memories of so many americans. You can't understand the importance of radio without hearing.

## Technical History

When we thing of technology that is the inventors. We see things like radio as user-to-user communciation (wireless telegraph), then we acknowledge how it's an early discovery. 

### James Clerk Maxwell

- Electromagnetic waves. Physical, not electronic.

### Henrick Hertz

- German, Experimented with Electromagnetic radio waves 1889, died at 36, why we called radio frequency a cycle per second

### Merconi

- Italian, wireless telegraph. Not entirely new, but did perfect the technology. Was a canada herritage video. 1909 - nobel Prioritized

### Reginald F

- Receiver design, first voice transmission in Canada. This was exceptional at the time

### Frank Conrad

- first radio broadcast. AFK - got tired of talking, would play music. He would get phone calls, established regular hours. Beginning of Broadcast Schedule

### David Sarnoff

Merconi company, music broadcasting. Radio music box. Ignored. People didn't see the value.

## New Tech Anxieties

- Machines, no technology's concequences are singular or compact. They are not easy to document. America calling. Much sooner if someone was ok after surgery. Once well protected privacy, accellerated the arrival of bad news.
- Tech and users how people reinvent radio. How it sculpted ... turned it on.
- 41: the fact that radio waves are visible, can send deep into the cosmos


### Oliver Lodge

- Undermines faith that we're part of one grand scheme. Radio, first proliforated between science and religion hit new intensities. 
- Radio, in america was different. It was written as a magical phenomenon. Bridged a widening gap between spirituality. 
- Burrowed into spiritual transcendence. Made possible by machines. Sir Oliver Lodge made this connection, newspapers, was he a quack?
- 1910-1920, raged with pop press of britain and america. Many of these people were in the press and idolized by millions. The prestiege of science was collosal.
- Sellout crowds, saiances, mediums, or communicating with the dead.

So while the technological history is an interesting starting point, we shouldn't end there.

Michelle Hilms, what if we don't look at it as a technology, but as a social practice grounded in electricity. Radio as a medium, technological and social. Implied uses. Important to know the names, how the tech developed, what are the other social developments?
- Mass culture. Changed the conception of the mass audience.
- New conceptions of nation and citizenship. We shift from a culture based on conversation into consumption.
- Functions of electronic mass media were struggled with over the structures. Evolved from radio broadcasting.
- tended to be a forgotten medium. Dark and fading memory. Podcasts have resurgence of oral media, still treated nostalgiacly. Room of poeple gathering around the radio. 
- The radio is now a more solitary listening experience.

## Broadcast Medium

Unique, transcended space and time. Not at a mass level. Not instant. Shared time and experience are very important. There's something special about knowing someone else is doing the same thing you do.
- Keeping you informed and up to date.
- Works to implode space as well (McLuhan). The village size. Literary man and electronic man.

When first instroduced, blurred public and private spheres. Radio news content. Often featured in public spaces. Was not uncommon to have public listenings. Significant point where it would replace the hearth.
dissolved strict boundaries.

## Music
Music was a big part of early music content. It's associated with emotion, time and place, and was previously passively listened to at church. You used to be able to own records, a technology that could play them. Early music broadcast reinforced...

Who could or should access particular insturments. Guitar or fiddle. Hot Jazz (African American). Influence a development of popular music genres to follow. Agent of respectibility or imputance?

Susan Douglas ... Early radio content. Radio colonized and ... Tinkerized the domestic sphere. Nerds were almost glamourous. Was new and brought them closer to women, who were trying to ... trap door of the races and gender pleasure. These were real changes. Desire, rebellion...

### Early Radio Entertainment

Before it was firmly established as solely commercial, they used to serve cultural functions. Programming used to play high class music. In the 1920's, it had a great amount of service for women. Health info, light musical features. While it did encforce an image of women.

By the late 1920s, ads and sponsors took on a more active role. In 1926, this changed when NBC put ads first. J Walter Thomson... turned to broadway for ... techspido clad, 20's-30's, might approach NBC with a tentative interest in buying a show. Almost immediately after convicing to buy, complaining to NBC about... we can do better with our own writers and directors. There was a shift, no longer sold advertisers. Ads made the content. They cut the networks out as the middle man, then sell back to you to put on the air.

## Radio Narriative

Showmanship. Their tastes, tabloid mind. Commercialism popular / sensationalist press. Established stars to lure in audiences. Big name variety shows, vastly superior. Dialogue sketch - serial comic strips, etc.

From these early sketches, a new form was developed, radio narriative. The variety enstilled a moral vision. Informative drama, light comedy dramas, etc. Some were sensationalized. True Detective mysteries (McFaddon). Heavily invested in radio. 

"Be Married and like it"

He also published true magazines, true romance, true experience, true story, true confessions. Basis for his radio shows as they were sensational stories, which were true.

As a counterpoint, there were fictionalized narriatives. Rural values. Untouched by disturbing concepts. Memory Lane (1800's songs). Nostaliga has been relevant.

Dialogue in the stories to frame the songs. Was a half-hr drama set in the mid 1800's. Common sense always triumphed.

### Sponsors

Radio narriatives were established by advertisers. Single sponsorship. Advertisers could use networks to reach large audiences. Networks benefits from the quality material produced by ad companies to build affiliates.

Both groups had interest in reaching large audiences.

Subtle or not so sublte. One example: vaseline, often worked into the show. The ads always benefited from the association of the show.

Fibby McGee and Molley - Smack out (1930's), general store. 4 characters. Smack out was built around their duets. Little girl, Teenie, Infamous teller of tall tails (smack out of what his customers wanted).

Fibber McGee was nationally aired from '35 to '52. Smack out characters + harlow wilcocks. (real person irl). Announcer for wax.

Shows aimed at children were not immune. Westerns and Little Orphan Annie both had radio clips. 

By the mid 1930's, they were distinct parts. Serials for housewives and children. Soaps made up 55% of daytime radio by 1955.

Emotional contortions, etc. Some of the best contemporary TV dramas. General Audience: evening. Prime time, variety comedy shows were common. Berns and Allen, etc. All being run by celebrities and bringing in other acts to fill in the content time.

Olsen Well's Genious of stage. McBeth with all black cast. Brought to CBS to do classics and literature. He put on productions like Treasure Island and Tale of Two Cities adaptations of literary classics.

This division between daytime low culture and nighttime high culture was indicitive of radio's social status upholding high culture for profit institutions.

## Listeners

70% of listeners at daytime were female. Represent of 55-60% of nighttime. 80% of household purchasing. Crude content like childres shows. Broadcasters have low culture times for kids/women for when the "important" people (men). 

Kept government regulation at bay.

### Power of Radio

Self barely gets intertwined with what they eye is thinking. Think about listening to the radio. Two types of active listening. Passive, active. 

Douglas: Passive Hearing / Active. Rarely interacted. Listening to radio while doing homework.

Linguistic / musical

3 possible modes of active listening.

- Informational, (basic effects)
- Dimensional (Minds eye to transport us different places), soap operas, etc. WORK!
- Associational (memory works in associative ways). Reminds you of something. Memory emotions, when memory forces us to recall...
- Oliver Lodge, tech was not well known to users. Invisible substance. Magic, process of using sound to create image. Sudden sounds have historically been used as alert systems. Sound is a sound source of reaism.

Stimulates the mind, forces us to create a theatre of imagination through suggestion.

War of the Worlds: panic. Anything they imagined was worse than they had seen. Deeply affected listeners. Brain likes it when we create our own listening. We might create our own 3D spaces. Naturally, this imagining is best when we don't listen. We also become more attached. This can be disappointing when we see things brought to TV through film.

The Hunger Games, etc. if you follow internet discourse about TV re-imagining people take issue.

## Living History
Sound is a time machine. The voices of the past in all their nuance, etc. alter the stories we tell about ourselves and give us the power to change it.
