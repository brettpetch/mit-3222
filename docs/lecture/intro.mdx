# Introduction

This intro will ask where are we, how did we get here? Think back to 2-3 years ago, looking at our time spent on our courses to here. We know we've seen alot of doom and gloom when it comes to historical media consumption practices. There are several physical, emotional, mental, media and technology practices.

Can we put ourselves in the toll those practices have taken us through. We've been introudced to exploitation in capitalism, dating back to as early as the industiral revolution.

## Capital vs. Labour

Labour: Users that take part in, but typically do not profit economically from online activities. From big tech platforms, etc. can oftentimes and are seen/feel like work. Whether we're sending a tweet or taking a tiktok. We're performing labour activities. The filming of tiktok is better than starting a weed-eater at 6:30am. If the product is free, you're the product. It used to be, and we'll see in early theory portions of the course that in north american/etc. media practices you were doing things for free. Watching your bachelor in paradise episode, acadamy awards. We've all seen the doom-and-gloom theories theory of media and information through the frankfurt school scholars that fled nazi germany. Adorno and Horkeimer believed we were lulling cretive capacities, machines tell you to consume. Media consumption habits were very close to the work of a 9-5 job, now in the hands of advertisers; like those we see at the superbowl pay for our attention.

We know that capitalism only ever grows by increasing the length of the work day or increasing the rate of production. We've seen in the past year and a half, who wouldn't want their names, viewing patterns, food consumption habits, etc. sold to advertisers while off-the-clock. We've heard of countless examples that one exploitative process or another are always on the clock.

Socioeconomically useless as they appeared previously. In many cases we've seen discourse engaged online that even act in favour of users looking to persue certain social causes. These web based activities that users engage in through online technologies of simply something other than the unwaged labour.

On the contrary, as shown by recent examples, #NeverAgain, #BLM, etc. Platforms can be used to express contrary view points to the dominant social discourse. Lets look at the audience members as infuencers. We've studied the dark side of platforms like Facebook, Google, Amazon, etc. We've seen the obvious underlying... the audience of the commodity. We got into this concept of commodity, individual audience members that take part in but do not profit economically from online platforms.

We can all agree that BTS we've had some landscaping workers, etc. being an influencer is no picnic either. These online platforms can be used as avenues for labour movmeents.

2100: the example of the google walkout, where G employees rallied against sexist practices in the business. Big tech is a shift away from top-down media models or the industrial information economy. This previously incuded very centralized production of information (or networked) involving very strict hiarchical buisenss model.

Big tech platforms / activities on them engages them online through big tech technologies. These are not as exploitative as they may appear. We have focused the majority of our time towards studying Big Tech platforms which are not only a revolution of social networking, this happens through extensive commodification of user information and surveillance. Does panopticon ring a bell?

However, in many cases discourse engaged by this audience commodity can act in favour of users who persued social causes. As such, the exploitative processes of the online unwaged labour... On the contrary, as shown by BLM #METOO, Occupy, online movements can be studied to represent ways that users host contrary view points contrary to the indusrial info economy. We have learned that (within our time in mit) that the audience that was typically exploitative can take advantage of the ... economy that materialize in offline life. Some of you are using big tech to pursue your own social causes.

We will be looking over "Public Sphere". We'll certainly be getting this notion of the public sphere, which we've looked at in various stages of this program. We can take that the public sphere increased the amount of power, agency, and deicion-making obtained and possessed by the labour force. As a result of this agency, the public body (or labour force), now possessed the ability to commmunicate and engage in debate regarding issues pertaining to government or state in democratic society.

### Public Sphere

The public sphere existed as an entity seperate from state regulation, opinion could be formed strictly in a public body.

Resulted in higher-level insitituions, or capital which owned by the means of prodcution, being increasingly open to public scruitny.

An increasing diversity of public and invdiduiduals able to scruitinize and be concerned with issues that concern them.

### Public Sphere vs. Big Tech

Do platforms possess the ability to be its own public body, for people to confer in unretricted fashion?

What are some examples of misinformation/etc. atm?

Vaccines, masks, social justice.

We've begun to accept that digital and social media outlets primarily exist as for-profit entities. In fact, we've seen users being able to manipulate media platforms and transform them into their own landscape.

With this notion of the public sphere, lets look at this in big tech.

Facebook, Twitter, YouTbue, TikTok, etc. generate user content provided by online audiences for free or at very little relevant cost. These platforms exploit users pf comm. tech to turn profit for owners of online production and advertisers by gathering patterns of users. Owners of Big Tech production capitalize on "work" performed by users.

Big tech platforms continue to evolve as extensive commodification like the panoptic practices of big tech companies that allow them to be operated on the panopticon.

Exploitation of user-generated content **is work**. We want to remove ourselves from that strain of thinking and look at it as work.

#### Youtube Ads - work

YouTube ads are forced to sit through at 15 sec. minimum. We know we perform activities like posting on Faebook, Tweeting, uploading to instagram, editing a Wikipedia page, etc. while these companies turn economic profit from content uploaded. As a result, we can look at this as immeterial exploitation of our online capacities. These work to reenforce capitalism.

#### Capitalist System in Cyber Space

At the turn of the centruy, it was becoming clear that the emergence of online platforms and increased availability of Internet technologies could be afforeded through ubiquitous connectivity to the middle and lower class, who may have been previously held without a voice in the contemporary public sphere. We see that equal access does not mean all-citizens. Social justice, etc. exclusion in the mainstream public sphere.

#### Info vs. Communication

Marxist scholars have noted that these lower class individuals... speak on behalf of themselves in an emerging networked info economy. Marxist scholars noticed a conflict between the information being presented by media outlets in an industrial info economy. The communication that is being presented by the audience in a networked information economy. Several marxist scholars wrote about hte new-found resources to be a place of tension between capital and labour`.

#### Capital vs. Labour online

Capital - ability to mfg online content.

Labour: ability to use platforms to comm. struggles iwthin an online realm

Labour: achieve online, autonomous public shpere which existed as seperate entity from capital influence.

#### Online public sphere?

Opened space for alternative comm. projects. These projects were parttaken by an autonomous audience. The opinion did not have to comply to rules and regulations determined by the state, creating a de-facto utopian public sphere.

#### Alternative comms

Internet media existed for the profit of owners of the means of online media technologies.

The new forms of online resistance is that for perhaps the first time in history, were able to speak in an arena where their voices could not be muffled. In theory, there exists a horizontal integration of power within new media technologies. There is 'equal opportuntiy' on comm projects like facebook, twitter, etc. We can view these aas alt-comm-projects.

Audience Response - Avenues that act on behalf of marginalized citizens rather than their oppressors.

There is a kind of horizontal integration ... of power on these new media platforms. Users of web 2.0 platforms have a moderately adequate means of... all you'd have to see is the responses to Donald Trump tweets prior to being de-platformed.

The audience on both sides of the political center can express whichever thoughts they'd like similar to the public sphere. BLM took to online apparatus to persue social causes of marginalization of african-canadian life. or #occupy, where twitter users recognized and persued the end of economic disparity.

### Top Down Coverage

For the purposes of this discussion to recognize that while internet technologies particularly in social media devices (platforms) still enforce capitalist ideologies in an online realm, it's also important to note that online new media tech that conflict emerges between info presented by mainstream media that is being altered before reaching the audience. These new media technologies have also empowered the audience.

For instance, mainstream media top-down coverage has been important for maintaining social control / set of economic practices have been accepted as 'the way things were'. Industrial information economy media ... act both conciously and subconsiousness punish deviance to expected social norms. Through this process in media outlets inherrantly act against those who hold a great deal of power within society.

While not always acting in the interest of oppressed classes without the ability to express themselves. The importance in the development in this tech is that they at least somewhat work to blur the lines over who controls information and communication.

Users do not need to voice opinions that reinforce and support established social norms. Now they have the ability to use tech ot recognize potential of networking to act in a democratic fashion.

As well as the ability to use internet technologies as a way of uniting media technologies. Has both space and time bias.

No regard for boundaries or borders of space or time. Previously, adorno and Horkeimer would argue that it would be very difficult to resist top-down media messages within a public realm in realtime.

### Conclusion

Platform technologies represent a new way for public citizzens to autonomously. contribute their opinions and beliefs and access those of others in a timely and consise fashion. Communication technologies provided a new potential for online "public sphere".
