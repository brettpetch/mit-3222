## The invention of the Audience

- People don't encounter the surveillance at every step. It does determine what is shown and when. 
- Radio techologies have been used from telephones, computers, Nielen boxes, audience measurement devices and other inventions that approach psychological media effects.

### Paul Lazarsfeld

### Adorno

- Class based critique, defined in alot of Adorno's work, Ch. 3 Radio in the UK vs US was difference. Radio in US vs "Wireless" in UK. UK Show "Mom".

## Early US Radio Comedy

- American comedy used comedy in different ways. IT focused on a linguistic slapstick -- the use of lanugage to satirise subject positions and rebel against hegemonic power strucutre,s particularly in the context of gender, race, and class.
- Actors who played Amis and Andy -- Show jumped back and forth between the colour line. White people were not just laughing at the black folks, but blurred the line. Slightly exadurated. 
- Racial Ventriloquism.
- Some people might disagree as well, but the Chris Rock routine in "The Office." Michael Scott has a good amount of admiration for black culture, but when he speaks in a way that is embarassing. It is racist, it's an interesting boundary that Michael Scott doesn't hate b* people, but he can only relate through reinforced stereotypes.

### Canadian Comedy

- Retired "This is that", a radio version of The Onion. Was responsive. It wasn't clear if they're real or fake listeners. We might be making fun of them for responding to fake news. 
- Debaters is a regular feature, silly debates, etc. Hailed to references.

### All Things Considered

- Public Service Station. Good example of public news radio. They talked to more everyday people, you wouldn't hear people on TV. Towards the end of the broadcast, they went to Barbers, locales that spoke to shifts. Playful use of sound. Crickets at night, etc. 90 mins to work with. You could hear long detailed stories. 

### This American Life

- 1995, tone and content is varying. First person narriatives. Jan 2012, Excerpt one-man-show agony and exposition of Steve Jobs. Remains one of the biggest of all time. Mr. Daisey wasn't entirely truthful. Daisey was given credit because he was basing it on people that he would have met. When *This American Life* discovered this, they made an episode to retract this information.
- Mike Daisey's One Man Show Interview: not clear about the line between fact/fiction. It's worth considering why it's so significantly important that they retracted this.
- One of their cousins at Marketplace, economics. Specific Parts of a show were authentic. After a bit, they couldn't say that they could prove it. Someone said that they had been poisoned... etc. Magical iPad -- marketplace went and discussed this and it was admittedly a fabrication. Dramatized issue. Alot of the facts were wrong. They were going to say that it was wrong. 
  - Website crashed for the program, was huge. Most downloaded show ever. 
  - Media repots about supply chain for Apple, etc. News crew to do a video of what a factory line was like. 
  - Retraction: went to the website and crashed the website.
  - Fact checking: "sounded right", but it was actually wrong. Performance -- The agony and extacy of Steve Jobs.
