Ok, so a little bit of adminstration. short assignment 5 is due this weke on friday. The pros and cons of binge-watching. The TV pitch is due April first, next week and you may notice that there's an option to do bonus marks. It can be up to 5% added directly to your final grade. That's something to think about, and you'd do it in-person in class. It doesn't need to be more than 5 minutes.

If you're going from one floor to another it's not long at all. That will be a live presentation, and it will be live. It cannot be recorded. It's part of the energy of it. If the normal rules don't apply, you might get the opportunity to do it over zoom.

Any other questions?

Any suggestions about the research about it? What suggestions on research, etc.

How much work should be done?
- You're going to have to differentiate between the research that you're going to do, then you're going to figure out what you're going to pitch, then let that research on comedy tv would work, aesthetic styles, etc. 

If you have done some research that's insturmental, people have research that is seperate from their pitch (is how you go wrong). Clear line about research that you show, vs research that is lined up.

Just to reiterate, it's not cumulative, it will only cover 5-12. Next week on reality tv, etc. Next will be open book, but no devices. Primarily because people can use a search function and that can speed things up. 

We need to be more specific in the future. If everyone had a digital copy, then there would be equity. We should keep things reasonable. There's only one portion of the TV studies book you'd want to bring in, and it's the chapter on audiences.

2 single sided pages of nodes, whatever font, etc. 

Questions:
If there is interest in a study session / review session, etc. maybe we'll do something like that. Send Tiara an email and she'll look at organizing that, either online or in-person. It's student lead, you asking questions to gain more understanding, etc.

Any other questions?

It's a pretty full lecture. Drama is a huge drama. We're going to start with Thorburn, on Television melodrama. There's a reason why I started with drama, and there are certain connotations. We're going to use drama after as I see them as being interchangable.

Thorburn was writing in the 70's. He was writing about the only tv programming he knew about. We were 25 years into television compared to now. Thorburn calls this culture's most characteristic cultural form. It's a particular story-telling format. Every scholar has the idea that they have the biggest, most important thing. 

He talks about how television is distinct in different ways. He brings us to the melo = music. It means that it's a dramatic text with musical accompanyment. It has a more pjorative implication. We use it as a way of being extra, things that make emotional appeals, etc. If someone said you were being melodramatic, that we need to rehabilitate the term.

So the characteristics of melodrama, if we break them down are very similar. We're really thinking about it as a television form. It's just a program form. So, characteristics, an hour long, no laugh track, etc. The emmies, etc. all had categories for comedy and drama. Half of figuring out what it is. Orange is the new black was comedy, then shifted to drama as it became darker.

People will fight over what makes something a sitcom. These are related to TV, and now you might not notice without commercials. It's still seperated into acts. They are acts structured around commercial breaks. You write the story with dips. Single camera approach. More filming. It's more episodic first, and you don't want people to depend on what happened this week. Serialized tv is a degraded form of storytelling, while dramas are not.

High culture, etc. Relates to the other reading. Now we can just agree that this is all drama. Whether it's melodrama, etc.

- Anthology series
- **Procedural**
- Scifi/fantasy
- teen series
- Period drama
- Docudrama (pan & tommy)
- Mini-Series (Waco/Chernobyl)
- Prime-time Soap
- **Longform Drama**

* bold are meta, we have talked about them before.

## Early evolution of tv drama

it transitioned from radio as an anthology drama, can have its own storyline/idea. You'll be using an edited collection, an anthology. They're like journal articles in a book. Black Mirror, etc. are anthologies.

1990's, medical procedurals, etc.

2000's - franchise procedurals, serialized network dramas, hero narratives, botique cable dramas, terrorist reponse narriatives (NCIS, hero, breaking bad, etc.)

2010's - Period drama, law and order and technology, apocolyptic narratives, superheroes / comic book universe, fairytales/supernatural.

2020's - Highly serialized. No need to have network pick what you are going to watch. Combining genres, etc.

Getting back to procedural dramas, why are they so popular?

- Chicago fire, etc. Some people personally like them but it's a pattern, the complexities of the storys, etc. 

Working with limitations. 

What is an example of a restraint: commercials. Rather than ebing an  interruption, you can use it to shape the rise/break of tension. You build so it happens right before the commercial break. It also makes it so people are less likely to change the channel. The potency of smaller units shock your people. We are getting these stories in bits and bites.

The small things are much bigger than the narriatives.

Build in a way that with commercials that it will break it apart and make it easier to jump between storylines.

Will be repeated. Audience doesn't expect reality, but good performances with believable reactions. It's about the actors. It doesn't matter if it's realistic. believablity of parts. Formula pushes the relationships.

Contrivants, part of the maturation process of melodrama as a form. Multiplicity. Particular drama will draw time and time again by using breif but crowded history. Gives actors a platform to build their stuff.

Episodic, always stops short of institutional critique. 

Cops and lawyers are common in melodrama. There are psycological flaws that show moral weaknesss, etc. good vs. evil plots. There aren't a whole lot of nuance. someone was making the difference between crimial and being bad person. 

It reinforces the status quo. It gives a false sense of justice. 

Concept driven procedurals.

Very little is known about personal lives, examples: dragnet.

Dragnet delivery, Seinfeld, library cop, etc. Dragnet delivery. There's something about the delivery that we associate with the crime drama.

The other side of it is the character driven procedural. It's really about the character. It's charismatic (if flawed individsuals). They might also be people who don't play well with others. The name of the show might picture the characters.

You can see alot of these people are identified. Kojack.

The cumulative narrative, the cumulative narriative balances the episodic and the serial. It continued with ER, Hill Street Blues, etc. Weekly episodes, cumulative. They have ongoing personal issues.

Distinct beginning, middle, end.
