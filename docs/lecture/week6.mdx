## Introduction

Today is the beginning of our television and radio. 

Industry Research, Form, Content.

Chapter from television studies about industry. Then we'll look at genre, narriative, form.

So, this comes up alot in a number of classes. Cultural studies are more interested in the texts themselves. Political Economy is all about adorno & horkheimer. 

## Administration

- Short Assignment Task #1 - grades to be relesaed late tonight or tomorrow morning. Short asn task 3, Representation on TV (due NEXT friday, feb 18.)

Dallas Smyth: audience commodity. You are the thing being sold (your attentive capacity). 

Cultural studies: interested in the texts themseves, what the text means, how users engage with texts. We are involved with a variety of ideas. 

Global TV: Globalization, capitalist imparitives on everyone. It's a problematic outcome. Then you start to think about the value of format trading. It's a huge thing in the early 2000's with reality tv. 

sell to countless ... get your own formula. Formats became very big and people liked to look at how they worked. You have a huge opportunity to capitalize on these things. It's quite interesting when we move into different areas. We see alot of things on Korean NF. The influence in the Telenovella form from south america... You can create a national identity, then export it.

How bad the american actors were -> big debate about how it happens there. They will just walk up to ask if you want to be in a movie.

Some of the actors were like I am an actor and it's bad that everyone 

you might also find global media flows and hubs. We have TIFF in Toronto, etc.

Regulation & Policy

Distribution/Viewing practices.

How many people would say that what you watch as "television" is tv services.

How many people have traditional cable?

Procedural drama
- every week something happens, it resets every week.

Soap Opera
- tells a serialized story.

One of the first genres is The Western. It's really a proto-police procedural.

They are obviously limited in plae/time (pioneers of television clip)

We also have other genres (non-fiction)
- Talk show
    - Daytime (women to watch)
    - Late-night (actors)
- Quiz show
    - way of selling women things
- Makeover
    - Proliferates as a program on its own. Makeover anything, house, car, downsize your pet
- Documentary
    - 
- variety
- Sports

## Forms:
- episodic (traditional tv, resets each week)
- serialized (binge culture, soap)
- non-linear ()
- interactive ()
- real time ()

## Strategies:
### Narrative (episodic)
    - Accerated exposition, circularity, limited memory
    - Multiple storylines, disperced character identification
    - Flexi-narrative closure and accumulation
    - Voiceover narration
        - Extradigetic vs intradigetic; breaking 4th wall
    - flashbacks / flashforwards
    - split screens

We don't get to see or know alot about certain charavters.

Truly choose your own adventure: bandersnatch.

We have these descrete genres, audiences get bored quickly. Grammar of television becomes very familiar. Hybridity is the genre mixing. The people who write about this describe it as new legibility for tv audiences who are familiar with old genre models. The office, for instance uses documentary and comedy. Mixing the two created a new genre. It coincided with the rise in popularity. Curb your enthousiasm, extras, etc. 

Intertextuality. Theoretically barthes, etc. Mutual association between text. Symbols, motifs, etc. that exist in each. We see it alot in the simpsons, etc.

Jessica Jones is about superheroes and villans. Thematically it's telling a story about grief and drama.

## Representation

When we look at it and engage as viewers/scholars: what the representation does, how audiences should/can use representation. 

There are some different research approaches. There are two broad approaches, which involve counting. This might be statistical analysis. The degree of which they are involved in cultural production. Who do we ... 

We see the media focus alot on the actors.

critical does not need to mean negative. Identity can be anything from race, ethnicity, gender, etc.

The others talk about how this is a field that can be over-dominated about what's positive/negative.

There's antoehr class classed womens television, I'd get alot of essays that say if a show is feminist again. At the end of the day, that's not interesting. It's more interesting to think about why we think that and what it means in a broader context.

Class Dismissed is an interesting and ... 

Euphoria
- wanted to shock so badly, not good for teens, parents, etc. It's trying to hard, it's not doing what it's trying to do.
