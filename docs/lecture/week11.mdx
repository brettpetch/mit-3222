Think about the genre of reality television. How does it work for the people involved? How many of you had career conference. Erica, OneSurvivor, said some things about why do we watch these shows.

John Corner situates reality tv in the form of documentary. People don't go to watch documentaries, but were more direct-to-tv. It suggests approach and purpose rather than the thing itself .It's the way of presenting information. There are practices & functions. We expect certain conventions, historically the documentary has marked the social world. 

Roles:
- Civics (propaganda, national advertising)
    - What makes a good citizen?
    - How do you become one?
    - Shows that teach you how to raise your kid, manage money, etc.

Direct cinema started in QC. It's an observational mode. It catches what it catches, you don't have alot of interviews, confrontation, etc. We know in the office that there's someone recording to them because the boom guy talks, etc. Survivor shows shots with cameras in them now. It's meta.

It makes us think that we're getting access to something "real". So rather than going to contemporary reality tv, we're going to look at some notable figures.

Low production quality, more authentic. 

Infotainment and reality tv, increased airtime, stretched budgets. 

Don't have to pay big stars. Shows that feature low production costs, infotainment. Meant to be public service, etc. Rescue 911, supporting details from interviews. COPS, on the scene footage. Association of shakey handheld (like blair witch). 

Hill says that reality tv is about constant regeneration. You want a certain amount of genre familiarity. You need to find a balance between excitement and familiarity.

Exposes documentary tricks, manipulation, editing, narrative contsrcution. They use editing, subjective camera, argue for the honesty of what's being depicted.

To be real, when people are still trying to be themselves. To help combat the idea of performance, many shows allow contestants to address the audience.

not access to un unmediated reality, but rather the reality of mediation.
